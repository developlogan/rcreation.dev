I've been wanting to make this announcement for a long while but I didn't want to disappoint anyone, but at this point I've had a massive loss of motivation so screw it.

ZeeCity: "BREAKOUT" has been postponed to an indefinite date. You won't see it for a long while. I would rather prioritize newer projects than stick to some game that I've been maintaining for 2+ years that has no general features whatsoever. ZeeCity has had a long run, and has inspired alot of people to start roblox developing. (And alot of people going down a wrong path). Starting now ZeeCity will be taken down and will not have any further development until I gain motivation to actually continue the ending event. It might not even be worked on when Rumble is done.

What About the Rumble storyline?

Rumble will have a storyline, but it won't be until really later on. I want to focus on the actual game before doing fun things with it. The Storyline will be entirely different, nothing from the ZeeCity story will be involved in Rumbles storyline.
